# PocketPenguin - Gameboy Emulator Project

## Overview

**PocketPenguin** is a **Gameboy emulator/simulator project** written in **Python**. Originally developed as a "Gymnasiearbete" (a Swedish upper secondary school graduation project), this endeavor combines the nostalgia of classic handheld gaming with a modern, modular interface. PocketPenguin allows users to explore custom games (like Block Breaker and Platformers) while showcasing innovative designs in game development and system emulation.

## Introduction

PocketPenguin aims to simulate Gameboy hardware while providing a platform for experimentation with retro gaming. By integrating classic game mechanics, a robust state management system, and custom 8-bit font rendering, this project serves as both an educational tool and a fun gaming experience.

Whether you're nostalgic for Gameboy classics or looking for a customizable emulator as a hobby project, **PocketPenguin** is the perfect starting point.

---

## Features

PocketPenguin includes the following features:

- **Gameboy-Style Emulation**: Simulates the Gameboy's display and functional behavior.
- **Custom Games**:
  - **Block Breaker**: An arcade-style game where you destroy bricks using a bouncing ball.
  - **Platformer**: A 2D side-scrolling game with enemies and platform challenges.
- **Dynamic Game States and UI**:
  - Main Menu, Pause Menu, Settings, Game Over, and Leaderboard management.
- **Custom Fonts**:
  - Retro `.bdf` fonts like `gameboy.bdf` and `mario.bdf` deliver authentic 8-bit aesthetics.
- **High Score Saving**: Scores are saved persistently in a JSON file.
- **Modular Architecture**: Developers can easily add new games or modify system behavior.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Adafruit CircuitPython 8.0.0+**
- Dependencies (installable via `pip`):
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-display-text`
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-displayio-shapes`
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-bitmap-font`

Additional hardware (optional):
- Adafruit FeatherWing joypad or similar for physical controls.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KlajdiFasho/PocketPenguin.git
cd PocketPenguin
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. (Optional) Connect Hardware
Connect a compatible display, joypad (e.g., Adafruit FeatherWing with I2C), and set up inputs as specified in `Handlers/input_handler.py`.

### 4. Run the Simulator
